## About the Project

ArtisanZen was created to practice **frontend development** with Vue 3 and Nuxt 3.  
It is a **dummy e-commerce frontend**, designed to simulate a complete shopping experience, but it does **not connect to a backend**.  

This project helped the developer understand **routing, components, state management, and SEO/meta handling** in Nuxt 3.

## Features

The project includes the following pages:

- **Home Page:** Displays featured products and categories.
- **Category Page:** Shows products within a selected category.
- **Product Page:** Displays product details, images, and price.
- **Search Page:** Allows searching for products (dummy implementation).
- **Cart Page:** Shows selected products.
- **Checkout Page:** Collects order details.
- **Checkout Confirmation Page:** Displays a dummy confirmation after checkout.

**Note:** All data is dummy and there is **no backend integration**.
